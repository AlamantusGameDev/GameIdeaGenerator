# README

This is an old version of the  
Insanity Jam Game Idea Generator   
Version 1.0

The newest version is hosted at [https://alamantus.gitlab.io/GameIdeaGenerator](https://alamantus.gitlab.io/GameIdeaGenerator)

Takes a seed and randomly generates a sentence by selecting random words from several word lists and by randomly selecting a sentence structure to place the words into.
This version has a completed set of word lists.

### Requirements

I recommend using the hosted version, but if you really want to use this version, which I don't recommend, you'll need these (many are included in the repository):

* [http://www.getbootstrap.com](Twitter Bootstrap) in a css folder at root. (Index also references a custom bootstrap css file called "jumbotron-custom.css", which is not included.)
* js/generator.js
* js/seedrandom.js
* js/jquery-1.x.js  (Any jquery, basically. If unchanged, this folder uses jquery-1.11.0.js or jquery-1.11.0.min.js)   
* js/pagescripts.js
* values/gametypes.txt
* values/nouns.txt
* values/pluralnouns.txt
* values/concepts.txt
* values/adjectives.txt
* values/locations.txt
* values/descriptions.txt
* values/verbs2nd.txt
* values/verbs2ndconcepts.txt
* values/verbs3rd.txt
* values/additions.txt

### How do I get set up?

* Load whole repository to a host and load the index.php page.
